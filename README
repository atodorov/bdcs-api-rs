Running the API in Docker
=========================

Build the docker image by running:

sudo docker build -t bcl/bdcs-api .

To run the API it requires access to a copy of the metadata.db created by
https://github.com/wiggum/bdcs and to a directory of recipes (which can be
empty initially or you can copy examples/recipe-example.toml into it as
'example').

You then run the API and composer-UI code like this:

docker run -it --rm -v ~/tmp/bdcs-db/:/bdcs-db/:Z -v ~/tmp/recipes/:/bdcs-recipes/:Z -p 8000:80 bcl/bdcs-api

You can then access the UI on the http://localhost:8000
